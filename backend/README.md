# Install the program (for developers)

1. Install [Miniconda (Python)](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html)  on your local machine, with default settings. You can access conda via the console, to make sure it's properly installed please run `conda -V` to display the version, and run `python -V` to display the version.

2. Create new virtual environment. Open Anaconda Prompt and run (taken an example of python 3.10):

    ```conda create --name selenium_env python==3.10 â€“y```

3. Once it's created you can activate it by running: ```conda activate selenium_env```

4. Go to (i.e. cd) the current directory, run ```pip install -r requirements.txt``` under the activated virtual environment

5. Set up environment variables for Windows System. Notice it might be slightly different from person to person. Typical PATH is C:\Users\user_ID\AppData\Local\Continuum\miniconda3\envs\selenium_env

6. To show hidden files in Windows OS:

7. Copy paste the .json file into *\backend folder. Otherwise the RPA cannot interact with Google Spreadsheet.

8. Run the run_demo.bat, it will call WO_journal_entry(demo).py, and check if everything works.
9. The current design is to download the latest ***Chrome Webdriver*** automatically when running the program, no need to manually download the webdriver.
